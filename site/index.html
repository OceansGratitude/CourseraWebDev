	<h1>Hello, Coursera!</h1>
	<p> I have something very concerning to tell you about your car's extended warrenty. You see, at the time that we sold you your car, we were going with a third party for the warrenties. That's exactly what you were hoping to hear, right? Well, yeah, it did turn out that the third party was actually a group of international space criminals, and they spent all THEIR money on a giant astroid made of popcorn and held together by marshmellow goo. Very disappointing. Well, all this is to say that we won't be able to help you out if your car explodes, even though you paid for it. </p>
	<p>Buuuuuuuuut you did sign out very specific waiver waiving us of liablity for your waiver. WHAT! The point of a warrenty is that we would be liable to help you if there's something wrong with your car because of a manufacturing error? Oh no! Lol whatever shall we do!</p>
	<p>Anyway, hope you enjoy the rest of your day! And don't contact us about it okay? I'm about to go on lunch and after that we're going bowling.</p>
	<p>	Asshole.</p>
